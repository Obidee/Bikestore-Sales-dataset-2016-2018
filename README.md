# Bikestore dataset
 Exploratory analysis on the sales data of a bike sales company between the years of 2016 and 2018 

This is a data set I got from https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-sample-database/ which describes the dataset of sales (between 2016 and 2018) from the database of a bike sales company.

Steps taken:
1. I downloaded the SQL dataset which was saved as MicrosoftSQLserver. I use MySQL, so I had to rewrite the load query in a way that MySql would understand.
2. Data Cleaning: The dataset was relatively clean, so there was not a lot to do by way of cleaning.
3. Perform EDA based on the problem statement from the challenge, using SQL and subsequently Excel.
4. Visualize the analysis using Excel.
